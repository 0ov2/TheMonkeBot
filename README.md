# TheMonkeBot
Welcome to MonkeBot. Monkebot is here to help with availability, scheduling and a few other QOL features such as slowmode for the community mods to use! This bot is desinged specifically for a Pavlov VR league community.

Examples:

Here is the code for weekly availability that the bot posts every sunday, with an example of the output that users will see

Here is the code and output example of the mixed friendly availability message that is posted every sunday.

This piece of code is for the role claim section of the message, if users react to the emoji they will get a specific role that is tagged along with the mixed friendly message so they don't miss out.
